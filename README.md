# Schläfli
This project is an easy to implement, easy to modify, WebGL illustrator for your webpage.
You can generate geometric shapes represented by Schläfli symbols or just view any 3D model you want. The goal is to add features such as 3D print, export 3D object to file and easy export to latex (for viewing 3D models in a pdf).

If you want to try it, download zip, extract, and run the html file in any browser, input any 2 dimensional schläfli symbol and hit enter. It currently only supports polygons(2D shapes). The geometric shape will appear in a WebGL canvas below the input field.

Why Schläfli?

Not alot of people seem to be awere that such a thing as Schläfli symbols are in existance. Schläfli symbols are extreamly useful for representing high dimetional geometric shapes, such as 4 or 5 dimentional objects, or objects in hyperbolic space. This project creates awareness about Schläfli symbols, geometric shapes in any number of dimentions and different types of space by letting people input any Shläfli symbol in the illustrator and see the result for them selves.

Right now more developers are needed.
