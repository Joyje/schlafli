# shl채fli
This project is a WebGL illustrator for geometric shapes represented by Shl채fli symbols. Just input the shl채fli symbol and hit enter, the geometric shape will appear in the WebGL canvas. It currently only supports polygons(2D shapes).
The project itself is contained in shlfl.js (and temporarily also buffers.js) and all the other files are code for basic WebGL stuff unrelated to sl채fli representations. These files are only needed if you do not already have a way of showing WebGL content.
