# Schl채fli
This project is an easy to implement WebGL illustrator for your webpage. You can generate geometric shapes represented by Shl채fli symbols or just view any 3D model. Just run the html file in any browser, input the shl채fli symbol and hit enter. The geometric shape will appear in a WebGL canvas. It currently only supports polygons(2D shapes).
The project itself is contained in shlfli.js (and temporarily also buffers.js) and all the other files are code for basic WebGL stuff unrelated to sl채fli representations. These files are only needed if you do not already have a way of showing WebGL content.
