# shläfli
This project is a WebGL illustrator for geometric shapes represented by Shläfli symbols. Just run the html file in any browser, input the shläfli symbol and hit enter. The geometric shape will appear in a WebGL canvas. It currently only supports polygons(2D shapes).
The project itself is contained in shlfli.js (and temporarily also buffers.js) and all the other files are code for basic WebGL stuff unrelated to släfli representations. These files are only needed if you do not already have a way of showing WebGL content.
